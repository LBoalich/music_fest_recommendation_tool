# Music Festival Recommendation Tool

---

## Description
This project was created to complete a Codecademy portfolio project for the Computer Science career path.  It uses python to make a text based tool that finds music festivals based on the user's preferences.  Users choose which type of festival they want to search.  Then they search for an artist by typing part of the artist name.  A list of matching artists is shown to choose from, which then generates a list of festivals that the chosen artist is playing.

## Features
*  __Useful__:  There are so many music festivals and it can be hard to choose which one to attend.  This tool can help users decide what festival they would enjoy the most.   

*  __Easy to use__: Users simply follow the prompts and type in their responses to search.  There are built in checks to make sure the user types the proper commands so that they do not get stuck.

## Improvements and Additions
* I would like to add more data that a user would be able to search through.  Adding genres and festival locations would make the searches even more useful.  For instance, if a user knew they were going to a certain festival, they could search for all artists in a particular genre to help them decide which shows to attend. 

* The current tree node class is not programmed to handle edge cases.  For example, the add child method doesn't check to make sure the child is an instance of the tree node class.  If it is not a tree node, it would be useful to use the data to create a tree node then add it as a child.
